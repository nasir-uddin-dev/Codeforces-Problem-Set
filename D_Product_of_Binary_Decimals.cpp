//  Product of Binary Decimals
//Let's call a number a binary decimal if it is a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1 010 111 is a binary decimal, while 10 201 and 787 788 are not.

//Given a number n, you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent n as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals
